    "## Background\n",
    "### Toronto is the most popular and most populated city in Canada, located in the Canadian province of Ontario. It has a population of 2,731,571, which is 1,026,877, approximately 60% higher than Montreal (the Canadian city with the second-highest population). On the other hand, with a population of roughly 8,175,133 people, New York City is the most populated city in the USA. There are five boroughs of New York: The Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island. Of the five boroughs, Manhattan is the most popular of the five boroughs and serves as the financial capital of the USA.\n",
    "### Each year, hundreds of thousands of people migrate to Canada yearly, and the United States of America (USA) is one of the top 5 origins of these immigrants[1]. Most of these immigrants settle in the province of Ontario. [2] The Ontarian city in which most immigrants settle in Toronto. Immigrants migrating from the USA and ending in Toronto may be doing so for a variety of reasons such as work, schooling, and family reunification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "### Many immigrants in Canada are looking for neighborhoods similar to their old neighbourhood when looking for a home. For example, a family with kids migrating from one neighbourhood to another may want to ensure there are similarly good parks and playgrounds in the new neighbourhood. Also, a young person relocating for a job opportunity may wish to enjoy bars and clubs in the new city as they did in the old town. It would be helpful if we can identify neighborhoods in Toronto that are like an immigrantâ€™s neighbourhood of origin. This information would assist real estate agents in targeting immigrants moving from a given region. Ultimately, real estate agents would be better able to recommend them homes for rent/sale in neighborhoods that suit them based on their previous neighbourhood. In this report, we will be reviewing immigrants migrating from Manhattan to Toronto.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interest\n",
    "### This information would be of interest to real estate agents looking to market the sale of homes to individuals settling into Toronto after migrating from Manhattan. Knowing neighbourhoods in Toronto that are similar to specific communities in Manhattan can help real estate agents better serve their clients (in this case, the immigrant).\n",
    "### Also note that, although this analysis is done on Manhattan and Toronto data, the study can also be replicated in other cities."

    "## Data\n",
    "### To make this determination, we may use locational data related to venues found in each neighbourhood. The datasets should include the Neighbourhoods of each city along with their respective latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates. The goal is to assess and determine neighborhoods located in Toronto that are like those found in Manhattan based on the available venues within the areas by modeling clusters of neighbourhoods to identify similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The data used in this report was sourced from multiple locations. Locational data of Toronto boroughs and cities were scraped from Wikipedia; however, the coordinate data needed for the analysis is not included. Coursera provided this coordinate data. Locational data of New York boroughs and cities are available on the New York University website. This data is then used to retrieve venue data from Foursquare API. The data that is received from Foursquare is a list of all recorded venues in each respective neighbourhood of Toronto and Manhattan."
